## Brief license

Now, that legalese is a lot to include for a small snippet of GLSL code,
particularly if you are trying to save on space for a demo. In addition
to the formal MIT license, we are hereby granting you permission also
under a simplified version of the terms. The conditions are the same,
but you are allowed to instead include the following brief header with the
function, referencing the MIT license by name only and pointing to this
repository. You may remove any other comments from the code and edit it
for compactness as you see fit, but please keep this minimal amount of
credit and information on where to find the original code. Source files
in the repository with "-min" in the file name have this short header,
have a compacted code style and are stripped of all comments.
